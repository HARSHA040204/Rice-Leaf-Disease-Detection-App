# Rice Leaf Disease Detection

## About the Project

### What is Rice Leaf Disease and How It Affects Food and Farmers
Rice leaf diseases are detrimental to rice crops, significantly impacting food production and the livelihoods of farmers. Diseases such as Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, and others can reduce yield and quality, leading to economic losses and food scarcity.

Our app is designed to detect the type of disease affecting a rice plant. If the plant is healthy, the app will display "Healthy." If an inappropriate image is uploaded, such as a human image instead of a rice leaf, the app will prompt the user to upload a proper image. 

Key features of the app include:
- Disease detection with dedicated prevention pages for each disease.
- A shop option for purchasing related prevention items.
- Weather updates showing live location weather and forecasts for the next two days.
- Image upload capability through the gallery or camera.
- User authentication with secure login, password recovery, and user detail protection.

## Dataset

### About the Dataset
This rice leaf disease dataset was collected both via the internet and independently. It consists of a total of 2627 images, categorized into six types of rice leaf diseases for training and validation purposes. The categories included are:

- Bacterial Leaf Blight
- Brown Spot
- Healthy
- Leaf Blast
- Leaf Scald
- Narrow Brown Spot

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dedeikhsandwisaputra/rice-leafs-disease-dataset).

## How to Run

2. In the terminal, run:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Set up your device (either a physical device or an emulator).
4. Run the `main.dart` file.
